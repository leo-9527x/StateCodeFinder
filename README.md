## Introduction

### Purpose

The main purpose of this document is to define the functional and technical specifications of the "State Code Finder" app. It serves as a guide for developers, testers, and stakeholders.

### Scope

This document focuses on the design, features, and technical details of an app that displays the code of a selected state.

### Definitions, Acronyms, and Abbreviations

- **State**: A federated state in the USA.
- **State Code**: The abbreviated code for each state (e.g., "AL" for Alabama).

## Functional Specification

### Overview

The app offers a seamless interface where users can choose a state and instantly view its code.

### Features & Requirements

#### State Selection

- Users can select a state from a wheel picker.
